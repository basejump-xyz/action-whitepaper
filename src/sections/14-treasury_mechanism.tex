\section{Clarification on Treasury Mechanism}

The Action treasury \textbf{does not function as an investment vehicle} and does not distribute revenues or profits to token holders. The treasury's primary purposes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ecosystem-building grants} to accelerate development of games, applications, and core infrastructure
\item \textbf{Developer incentives} to attract and retain talented builders in the Action ecosystem
\item \textbf{Real World Action} initiatives supporting environmental and social impact projects
\item \textbf{Operational sustainability} to ensure the long-term viability of the Action protocol
\end{itemize}

\noindent All treasury disbursements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject to community governance decisions
\item Tracked through transparent reporting mechanisms
\item Aligned with ecosystem growth and community goals
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{No portion of the treasury is distributed to token holders as a dividend, yield, or revenue share.}
