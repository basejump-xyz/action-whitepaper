\subsection{Adoption Plans}
\begin{itemize}

\item Incentivize gamers to play games on Action by rewarding them both ACTION and hyperobjects, leveraging mechanisms such as invite-to-earn and play-to-earn
\item Incentivize creators and studios to publish hyperobjects and bring existing game assets to the Action substrate
\item Partnerships with decentralized platforms like AO and Arweave
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exchange Listings}
Focus on DEX and CEX integrations with liquidity incentives. Strategic partnerships with exchanges will be prioritized to maintain alignment with Action's core values of sovereignty and decentralization

\subsection{Community Engagement}
Educational content, workshops, and collaborative initiatives to onboard participants, e.g. hands-on learning through game jams, creator workshops, and technical documentation to empower developers and creators to build on the Action substrate.
