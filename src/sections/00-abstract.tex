The Action substrate is a decentralized framework designed to empower creators, incentivize participants, and establish sustainable digital economies. A network built on AO's decentralized compute layer, the Action substrate enables the creation and interoperability of sovereign worlds, games, game assets, and communities. At its core lies the ACTION token \ref{fig:action_token_symbol}, enabling interaction within the Action ecosystem, including governance participation, hyperobject creation, and economic coordination. Action prioritizes originality, collaboration, and sustainability, linking digital innovation to real-world impact through treasury-supported initiatives.
