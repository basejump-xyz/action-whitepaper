\section{Governance and Progressive Decentralization}
The Action ecosystem will implement a \textbf{phased approach to decentralization}, reducing reliance on the initial team while empowering community-driven governance over time.

\subsection{Phase 1: Early Governance \& Operational Control (Year 1-2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Initial governance will be led by the Action founding team and key ecosystem contributors
\item Governance parameters, including treasury allocations and ecosystem incentives, will be established in consultation with the community
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2: Transition to Community Governance (Year 2-4)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Governance will transition to an \textbf{Action Foundation or DAO}, ensuring more distributed decision-making
\item The governance model may integrate \textbf{quadratic voting mechanisms} and weighted participation based on meaningful ecosystem contributions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3: Fully Decentralized Governance (Year 4+)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Action Foundation or DAO will have full control over protocol development, treasury allocations, and governance proposals
\item Core development teams will continue to support the ecosystem, but decision-making authority will be \textbf{fully vested in token holders and engaged participants}
\end{itemize}
